### Hey there! 👋

I’m a Computer Science Major with a curiosity for how software really works. I explore systems, understand their design, and find ways to make them a little better.

In my expereince ( still emerging ) I have learned that good engineering comes from curiosity, clarity and consistency — and I’m here to keep learning and building along the way.

For me, it isn't about just making systems, but with the idea of making things efficient, resilient, and fundamentally well-engineered.

## My Highlights of 2025 
*Here are a few of the challenges I've enjoyed tackling and the ideas from which they originated.*

#### 🚀 Time-Series Database Engine
Admired by how data is stored and retrieved efficiently in systems such as Influx, Prometheus, I engineered a custom time-series database from scratch in C++. By implementing custom compression (Delta-of-Delta/XOR) and a cache-aware storage layout, I was able to cut storage requirements by roughly 50% and deliver p99 read latencies of **under 1.3ms** on hot data (commodity hardware).

#### ⚡ Distributed Fault-Tolerant Cache
To explore high-concurrency systems, I designed a distributed cache using Python, `asyncio`, and `gRPC`, the plan was ensuring both speed and  availability. The final system was benchmarked to handle **17,000 ops/sec** on commodity hardware  and used consistent hashing and replication to guarantee **zero data loss** during simulated node failures.

#### ⚛️ Quantum vs. Classical Benchmarking (GSoC @ CERN-HSF)
During my time with Google Summer of Code at CERN, I  worked on the grounds of benchmarking quantum vs. classical computing algorithms for particle trajectory reconstruction. I architected a cross-platform Python framework to automate a complex 4-stage workflow, processing over **millions data points** from physics simulations to generate final analysis reports.

## Technical Skills
-   **Languages:** C++ (STL), Python, Java, TypeScript, SQL
-   **Full Stack & Backend:** Spring Boot, FastAPI, React.js, Node.js, gRPC, PostgreSQL
-   **Infrastructure & DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, Linux (Bash), GitLab CI, Redis, Kafka
-   **Scientific & Data:** NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, CUDA, ROOT (Basics), Geant4
